## Project Brief
To plan, designs and implement a solution for automating the development workflows and deployments of the Pet Clinic application. The full technology stack is as follows:

* Jenkins acting as a CI Server
* AWS (Amazon Web Service) as the Cloud Platform
* NGINX as the Reverse Proxy

## Project Planning
### Risk Assessment
Prior to the commencement of the project, a Risk Assessment Table was produced in order to keep track and understand any of the possible risks to the project. Having this created prior to the commencement of the project allows for preemptive measures to be taken and can be updated during the course of the project should any new risks or issues arise or become apparant. The Initial Risk Assessment Table can be seen below:
